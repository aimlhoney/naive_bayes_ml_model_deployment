Dear Friends ,  I have created this repository for Naive Bayes Logistic Classifier Model Deployment for Email Spam and Ham.
For dataset and notebook for the same you can use the below kaggle Notebook.

For the model import and export I have used Pickle Library and yes don't Forget to import CountVectorizer Object.

Happy Coding : )
